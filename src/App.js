      <p>
        Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a
        solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a
        solid inner core. The planet's density is the second highest in the
        Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3 , only slightly less than Earth's density.
